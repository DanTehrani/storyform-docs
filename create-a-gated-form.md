# Create a gated form

You can create a gated form that only eligible respondents can submit. (You can also create a gated anonymous form.)



By creating a gated form, you can collect answers only from respondents who own an Ethereum address that is in a particular set of Ethereum addresses.



Please send us an email, if you are interested in creating a gated form.
