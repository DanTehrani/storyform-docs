Storyform is a decentralized/composable survey tool. The surveys and answers are plainly stored on Arweave, making them composable.

You can read more about the vision behind Storyform in [this blog post.](https://medium.com/@dantehrani/storyform-integration-of-composable-knowledge-and-zero-knowledge-proofs-in-practice-51f1094a9c07)

We use the word _Form_ and _Survey_ interchangeably. We considered unifying the term to either, but there are cases where one word fits more than the other. Hence we decided to use both.
