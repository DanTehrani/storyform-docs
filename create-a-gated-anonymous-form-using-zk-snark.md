# Create a gated anonymous form (using zk-SNARK)

By creating a **gated anonymous form**, you can require respondents to prove that they are eligible to answer while preserving their anonymity. This is useful in forms such as employee feedback, whistleblowing, and harassment report, which respondents might be hesitant to answer honestly in usual circumstances.



As of today, the zero-knowledge proof is created using an Ethereum wallet.

There needs to exist a **list of eligible Ethereum addresses** to create a gated anonymous form.



Please send us an email, if you are interested in creating a gated anonymous form.
