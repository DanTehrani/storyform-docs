# Create a gated anonymous form (using zk-SNARK)

By creating a **gated anonymous form**, you can require respondents to prove that they are eligible to answer while preserving their anonymity. This is useful in forms that respondents might normally be hesitant to answer honestly, such as the followings.

* employee satisfaction survey
* harassment report
* whistleblowing



As of today, the zero-knowledge proof is created using an Ethereum wallet. There needs to exist a **list of eligible Ethereum addresses** to create a gated anonymous form.



Please [send us an email](mailto:contact@dantehrani.com), if you are interested in creating a gated form.
