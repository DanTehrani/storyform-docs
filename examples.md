Here are some example surveys built with Storyform.

  * [Survey](https://www.storyform.xyz/forms/0x4557f4fbce55a9114ead55d7fc952fd87c2dbfc513d09bd8f1d22986f0f54288)
  * [Responses](https://www.storyform.xyz/forms/0x0b68bb57437fcc55850af68abe42cc45c72e2ec3030fa6074d44a43af51442c1/submissions)

  * [Survey](https://www.storyform.xyz/forms/0x01a325e0666c4a54c1e5d1b9993e90a3fee801861e970b9e82d9a49d3f79bae7)
  * [Responses](https://www.storyform.xyz/forms/0x01a325e0666c4a54c1e5d1b9993e90a3fee801861e970b9e82d9a49d3f79bae7/submissions)

In Storyform, all of the submissions are plainly stored on Arwevae for everyone to see. So our solution doesn't suit some types of surveys. (e.g. collecting email addresses) Although, we are open-minded to introducing survey submission encryption to realize surveys that involve personal information.

Therefore, as of today, we recommend using Storyform for only surveys which the results are meant to be public in the first place.
